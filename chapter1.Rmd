Making sense (science) of data through open source methods. Sense is made out of  is made of data that is open using methods that are open.  

I look forward to acquiring new skills in the course although I know for sure it is not an easy task to achieve I am even a bit scared.  

If I remember correctly I heard about the course in Yammer.  

Right now am like we take it as it comes I have not used R so intensely as i have done with the first two practice, took some time and cracking of brain but not too bad.
